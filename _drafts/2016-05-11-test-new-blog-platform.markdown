First post with the Jekyll blog system which uses plain old markdown files. The beauty of this is that Github understands Jekyll and automatically runs ```jekyll build``` on the site and serves it after every push.

Any pictures or linked files are stored in the assets folder.

Note I have some sample blogs already in here - these were not written by me but are just some dummy entries for testing.
