I've taken a keen interest in Machine Learning this year and started off by enrolling and completing Andrew Ng's Stanford course on Machine Learning o Coursera - which was excellent!

The course was an introduction and covered a broad range of topics starting with Linear Regression and taking you on a journey through Logistic regression, SVM, Neural Nets and so on. Covering both main areas of Supervised and Un-supervised Learning.

The course focussed on using MatLab for the exercises which is a great way to begin with as its really designed and suited to matrix math - which is what ML is all about! However I'll be concentrating on Python now which is the defacto standard language in the data/science space.

If you want to take this course yourself I highly recommend it. You only need some basic linear algebra and calculus (derivatives and basic use of the chain rule is about all there is).

So given that... I now want to make use of some of this new-found knowledge and start *building stuff*. I'll basically be using this blog as a way to document what I do as I go.

Initially I'd like to play with some computer vision tasks on a Raspberry Pi. Motion detection; face recognition and so on.
First project being to get OpenCV running on the Pi and try out a few motion detection algorithms. Saving key-frame footage to dropbox.

## SAP ?
But hang on.... I'm a software engineer in SAP's technologies. Whats the point of this.?

Well firstly - its very interesting and the hottest topic in tech right now. Secondly - machine learning is going to touch every facet of our lives in one way or another and it will also become a big part of any developers life as well.
I have no doubt that its only a matter of time before I'll be doing this sort of stuff with SAP technologies as well (in the day job). SAP HANA already includes some ML algorithms like K-Means built into its analytics library.
Without a thorough understanding of those techniques however they are pretty much useless...

## Next...
My next few posts will be about setting up OpenCV and python on the Raspberry Pi and my laptop which runs Max OSX. Coding will be done on the Mac and when I've got something good to run I'll move it to the Pi.
